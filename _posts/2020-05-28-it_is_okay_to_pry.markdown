I have found it helpful to use Pry when your code is not working as it should. Pry can reveal where you went wrong. It will be helpful if you know how to read errors well, so you can pinpoint exactly where you need to bind your Pry. With Pry, you can find out what the objects in your code represent or what a variable will return. What Pry does is it “freezes your program so you can get inside your code and find out what’s going on and what needs fixing.” (Melissa Williams: https://www.honeybadger.io/blog/debugging-ruby-with-pry/). That way Pry helps us debug our code to make sure it does what it is supposed to do.

Pry is even better than IRB, as it has more features like “gives you color-coded syntax, which helps when you’re trying to figure out what will happen when code is executed. It makes mistakes easier to spot, which makes your code easier to fix.”(Melissa Williams: https://www.honeybadger.io/blog/debugging-ruby-with-pry/). I couldn’t have said it better!
